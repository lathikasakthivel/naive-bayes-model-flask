# naive-bayes-model-flask
This is a mini web application built using Flask that allows users to upload datasets in CSV or Excel format, or manually input data using a table interface. The app trains a Naive Bayes classification model on the dataset, stores it as a .pkl file, and classifies instances based on the trained model.
